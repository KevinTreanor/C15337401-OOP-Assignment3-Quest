## Description

Quest is a 3rd person adventure game made in the unreal engine. We did our best to include the most important aspects of a quest game: Platforming, puzzle solving and combat. Platforming is eased onto the player in the early parts of the game as the lake is forgiving. Puzzle solving takes the form of the maze and Combat can be seen thorugh out the level with the different classes of enemies and the boss.
Our game also has advanced player mechanics for players who want to speed run the game with a slow motion and sprint ability.
